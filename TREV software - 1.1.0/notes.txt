The Software/trev_pc_control directory contains the Processing sketch (written in Java) which implemented the 3D visualization and control interface we looked at on Friday. 

The Hardware/Firmware/trev_led_control_is31fl3728 directory contains the headset firmware (written in C++) which controls the LED arrays and the ready state light brightness. The code includes comments which explain how it works and how to use it.


There are 15 levels of brightness. In the control software (trev_pc_control) pressing the left and right keys will now adjust the brightness of the LED arrays.
